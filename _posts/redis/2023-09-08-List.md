## When to use
- Append only or prepend only data
- Time series data
ex) temperature readings, stock values \
Non-stop overtime!
- Need to only fetch last or first element is reuiqred only. \
But this requirement is also implemented in sorted set. \
So use sorted set instead of list

> Data is organized by insertion order or time order

## Don't use
- You need to apply some filtering criteria
- Data requires sort by some attribute. \
In List, there's no filtering command

## Tips
This is not an array!!! \
This is implemented as doubly linked list. \
Store an ordered list of strings.
