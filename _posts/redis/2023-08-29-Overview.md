## Why use redis
1. Faster than other DB \
REDIS is abbreviation of **RE**mote **DIC**tionary **S**erver
2. Simple and organized data structure \
Redis support strings, hashes, set, sorted set, list
3. Simple feature set comparing to other DB \
In redis, there's no triggers, data schema, FK constraints, Transaction rollback etc..

In same bracket `[]` we have to use only single option not multiple options.


## Why expiration is required?
Redis is memory based db and it origins from cache.

1. Delete old cache \
Guarantee data consistency between redis and traditional database (original data)
2. Prevent from running out of memory

> Expiration is for caching!
