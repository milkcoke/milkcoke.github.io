## Exclusive Lock
Usually, write.
It's like a mutex lock
#### Lifetime
In a single transaction

Only one transaction can get exclusive lock.

## Shared Lock
Usually, read.

#### Lifetime
In multiple transactions

Multiple transactions can get shared locks.

## Dead Lock

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO test
VALUES 20

INSERT INTO test
VALUES 30
```

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO test
VALUES 30

INSERT INTO test
VALUES 20
-- DeadLock Occurs
```

DB Rejects transaction and fail when deadlock occurs.


## Two Phase Lock
Usually used with `snapshot` isolation level.
It resolves Lost update and Phantom Read.

#### Why to use
Avoid race condition
Booking problem

>  Two phase locking is robust enough to block all possible race conditions among concurrent transactions including phantom reads, lost updates and write skew.
Readers don't block writers and Writers don't block readers.

#### Example
A book seat 1 which is empty in SELECT transaction
B book seat 1 empty in SELECT transaction

A succeed book seat 1 in transaction and COMMIT!
B succeed book seat 1 in transaction and COMMIT!

=> Lost Update "A"
