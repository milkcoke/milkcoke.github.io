# BTree
This is the common data structure when DB store index.

- Each node has key - value
- Each node is a page
- N = M - 1 \
N: the number of element in a node \
M: the number of children nodes

## Limitation of BTree

![BTree structure diagram](/assets/img/btree/btree_structure.png)

1. Require more space since it has key (PK) : value (RowID) \
👉🏻 more nodes == more page == more IO required => ⚠️ Make slower!
2. Range based queries are slow because of random access \
There's a lot of disk I/O jump even though PKs are sorted.

> This limitation is the reason the B+Tree appears

# B+Tree

Actually, each node has multiple key-values. you'd remember the page size is 8KB or 16KB that is different according to DBMS.


### What's difference?
- Each root, internal nodes have only keys. \
  👉🏻 more elements => lower pages => lower I/O => Faster!
- Each leaf node has key-value \
value is a pointer to row (Row ID)
- Leaf nodes are linked
Once a leaf node is found, there is no need to check from the tree root \
👉🏻 **This makes range-based query faster.**


#### Efficient range-based query

### Check points in B+Tree
- **Most DBMS use B+Tree** \
even MongoDB
- Indexes are located and fit in In-memory
- Leaf nodes can live in data files in the heap.
- Leaf nodes are linked, and the cost of linking is cheap.
