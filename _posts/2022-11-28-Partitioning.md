## What's Partitioning
Split the big table into multiple logical tables in the same table.

## When to use Partitioning?
If table size is bigger and bigger , Indexes should being large, **the queries could slower than before**

**Partition the table with index!** \
=> Query to small size indexes so targeting specific partitioned table! \
=> **Faster than whole index scanning!**


### Horizontal vs Vertical Partitioning
#### Horizontal
Split rows range, list, hash based.

#### Vertical
Splits columns partitions (Not recommended)

## Partitioning Types
#### Range
Dates, ids\
(e.g. `year` of logDateTime , `userId`)

ex) If you don't use log date before `2015 years`, You can archive old partitions to cheap storages.

#### List
Discrete values \
ex) zip codes


#### Hash
Hash function decides where to store the data.

Cassandra, DynamoDB uses this strategy as default.


### ⚠️Partitioning is not Sharding
> Sharding splits big table into multiple physical tables across multiple DB Servers.
> On the other hand, Partitioning have multiple logical tables in same table in same server.


# Example partitioning in postgres

## Normal table

### 1. Create test table
```sql
CREATE TABLE grades
(
    id    integer generated always as identity
        constraint grades_pk
            primary key,
    grade integer not null
);
```

### 2. Insert 10 million rows.
```sql
INSERT INTO grades(grade)
-- key range (0 ~ 99)
SELECT floor(random() * 100)
-- generate 10 million rows
FROM generate_series (0, 10000000);
```

### 3. Create index on grade
```sql
CREATE INDEX grades_grade_index ON grades(grade);

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM grades
WHERE grade = 30;
-- 100103
```



### 4. query on table
#### Non partitioning result (equal query)
```sql
-- Let's analyze query execution plan
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM grades
WHERE grade = 30;
```

```text
-- on base table's index!
Index Only Scan using grades_grade_index on grades
        Heap Fetches: 0
        Execution Time: 20.612 ms
```

#### Non partitioning result (range-based query)
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM grades
WHERE grade BETWEEN 30 AND 35;
```
```text
Parallel Index Only Scan using ...
                    Heap Fetches: 0
Execution Time: 42.094 ms
```

> 💡 You must execute above first, and follow next section since it's reused in this section above the `grades` table.

## Partitioning Table
### 1. create table with partition
```sql
create table grades_partition
(
    id    integer generated by default as identity,
    grade integer not null
)
    partition by RANGE (grade)
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE g0025 (LIKE grades_partition INCLUDING INDEXES);
ALTER TABLE grades_partition
    ATTACH PARTITION g0025
    FOR VALUES FROM (0) to (25);

CREATE TABLE g2550 (LIKE grades_partition INCLUDING INDEXES);
ALTER TABLE grades_partition
    ATTACH PARTITION g2550
        FOR VALUES FROM (25) to (50);

CREATE TABLE g5075 (LIKE grades_partition INCLUDING INDEXES);
ALTER TABLE grades_partition
    ATTACH PARTITION g5075
        FOR VALUES FROM (50) to (75);

CREATE TABLE g75100 (LIKE grades_partition INCLUDING INDEXES);

ALTER TABLE grades_partition
    ATTACH PARTITION g75100
        FOR VALUES FROM (75) to (100);
```

### 2. Insert 10 million rows from `grades` table
```sql
INSERT INTO grades_partition
SELECT *
FROM grades;
```
> Everytime you insert row to grade_partition table, \
> **The DB will decide which partitoin that row goes to based on the value of grade.**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM g0025;
-- count: 2499474
-- only partitioned rows are showned!
```

### 3. Create Index
Only create index on leader partition table \
It will crate same index on all the partitions!

```sql
CREATE INDEX grades_partition_idx ON grades_partition(grade);
```


### 4. Query on table
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM grades_partition
WHERE grade = 30; -- 30 on partition 'g2550'
```

#### Partitioned result
```text
-- search index in partition 'g2550'
Index Only Scan using g2550_grade_idx on g2550 grades_partition
Execution Time: 17.511 ms
```

> Even if not shown difference between non-partition since my M1 Macbook Pro have enough RAM memory and performance. \
> There should be difference between them if there's limit of main memory or lower performance environment. \
> Large index size (Non - partitioned table) vs Small index size (Partitioned table)

## Compare the size
```sql
-- give you the size of the relation
SELECT pg_relation_size(oid), relname
FROM pg_class
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(oid) DESC;
```

#### Non-partitioned table
Large data and index size
![Non-partitioned size](/assets/img/partition/non-partitioned_size.png)

#### Partitioned table
![Partitioned size](/assets/img/partition/partitioned_size.png)

Smaller indexes size guarantee better performance on index scan query!

## 📝 Tips
> Always enable `partition prunning`!

```sql
SET enable_partition_pruning = on; -- default on
```

If you `off` that option, query will scan all partitions across whole table.
