This depends on your application.

## Choose Postgres
**Frequent Write operation**
#### why?
Postgres has secondary index architecture. So re-balancing operation cost of insert & delete is cheaper than Clustered index. \
However, postgres create a process with large memory (almost 10 MB) per connection. This is the cause of lower speed in read operation comparing to MySQL using thread.

## Choose MySQL
High volumes of reads. \
MySQL has two types threads, foreground and background

### MySQL's Threads
#### Foreground thread
Read operation from buffer or cache. \
Borrow a thread from thread pool. \
A thread request connection to Connection pool, if there's not available (idle) connection it should wait for other thread to return the connection.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è MySQL community edition doesn't support connection pool.

#### Background thread
Usually, Do write operation especially between buffer <-> disk.

- Merge inserting buffers.
- Logging to disk
- Monitoring Lock & Deadlock
