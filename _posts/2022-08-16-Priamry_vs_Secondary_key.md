## Primary key
Organized, clustered table. we call it **Index Organized Table (IOT)** \
Clustered index that is sequential is not that bad. So,
it's ordered data and can use efficient caching mechanism. \
If not, memory in heap would jump left and right, That will not benefit of memory caching DB is doing.

## Secondary Key
This is used in non-clustered index. \
Have an additional outside index as B-Tree. It's not in table.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Postgres doesn't have primary index. All indexes are secondary index.


## Non-Clustered Index
- Located in separated memory section. \
  So, should jump to HEAP
- One or more exists in a table.
- Store value and a pointer to actual row that holds data.
- The leaf node has only included columns.
- Just logical order, not organized physically.
- Composite key when used with unique constraints of the table act as non-clustered index.
