## History of MongoDB Engine
### MMAPV1 (~v2.x)
Map based data structure.
So it has disadvantage about range-based query, concurrent update.

ID is consists fo Diskloc(collection data file name) + offset (bytes)
### WiredTiger (~v5.1)
Support Document level locking so it's able to update 2 document concurrently.
Primary index `_id` and secondary indexes have been changed to point to recordId (a 64 bit integer) \
instead of the Diskloc. It's like a Postgres which point to rowID.
Support compressed BSON. => Lower I/O => Lower Page => Getting more document -> Efficient Operation!

$$Time Complexity = Log(N) * Log(N)$$

## Current MongoDB (v5.2 ~)
Uses clustered index like MySQL.
But it's not enforced.

Secondary indexes are easy to bloat since `_id` is large (12 bytes). It no longer point to recordId.
RecordId should point to _id which is 12 bytes.

## Limit of Document Size
- Maximum: 16MB
- Minimum: 255KB

## Index on MongoDB
Support Secondary and Primary index.
It's easy to bloat size of secondary index since `ObjectId` is 12 bytes.

#### ObjectID (_id)
12 bytes PK.
